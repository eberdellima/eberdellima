<h2 align=center> Hi, I'm Ergi ðŸ‘‹ </h2>

I'm a software engineer [@Ritech](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ritech-solutions-ltd./mycompany/) working primarily with web applications. I have experience with Javascript, PHP, and Go. Knowledge sharing is something I really enjoy and most of the time I'd be reading articles or hands-on trying things.

My current focus is sharpening my Go skills, so if there's any project you need help with or something you wanna try, I'd gladly help with that.

How to reach me:
- Ping me on [my LinkedIn account](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ergi-berdellima/)
